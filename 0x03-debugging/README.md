# 0x03. C - Debugging

### [0-main.c](https://github.com/MrGiddy/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x03-debugging/0-main.c)
Tests that the function positive_or_negative gives the correct ouput when given a case of 0 

### [1-main.c](https://github.com/MrGiddy/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x03-debugging/1-main.c)
Comment out the part of the code that is causing it to go into an infinite loop.

### [2-main.c](https://github.com/MrGiddy/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x03-debugging/2-main.c)
Fix the code to correctly print out the largest of three numbers, no matter the case.

### [3-print_remaining_days.c](https://github.com/MrGiddy/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x03-debugging/3-print_remaining_days.c)
Fix the print_missing_days() function so that the output works correctly for all dates and all leap years.
* You can assume that all test cases have valid months (i.e. the value of month will never be less than 1 or greater than 12) and valid days (i.e. the value of day will never be less than 1 or greater than 31).
* You can assume that all test cases have valid month/day combinations (i.e. there will never be a June 31st or November 31st, etc.), but not all month/day/year combinations are valid (i.e. February 29, 1991 or February 29, 2427).
